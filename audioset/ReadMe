To run the test code provided, please first set up a virtual environment, and ensure the following packages are installed:

pip install import numpy
pip install tensorflow-gpu > 1.8.0
pip install scipy
pip install sklearn
pip install soundfile
pip install librosa
pip install matplotlib
pip install pydub

As the pretrained tensorflow model was too large for MMS, it has been uploaded to my Google Drive.
Please download it from the following link, and save it into the 'audioset' folder found within this current directory.

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gNJXvdTqFVhAxVnuI_zqqaJzXi5av86w?usp=sharing

Within this folder is the trained model, a sample testing set (in the form of a pickled object containing preprocessed audio MFCCs).
It also contains some information from the training/validation phase, in order to produce some graphs of how it learnt.

Finally, please navigate into the 'audioset' directory, and run the 'CNN_sound_effect' python script, using the following command:

python ./CNN_sound_effect.py
